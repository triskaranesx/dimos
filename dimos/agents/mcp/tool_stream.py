"""Server-initiated tool-stream notifications.

A skill uses ``ToolStream`` to push text updates out to any connected MCP
client (Claude Code, our own ``McpClient``, curl, …) while the skill's
background work is still running.

Transport: each ``ToolStream.send`` publishes a ready-made JSON-RPC
``notifications/message`` frame on the shared ``/tool_streams`` LCM topic.
Skill workers and the ``McpServer`` process typically live in different
workers, so we lean on LCM's local-multicast bus to cross that boundary.
``McpServer`` subscribes to the topic once, forwards each frame to every
connected ``GET /mcp`` SSE client, and drops frames when nobody is
listening — there is no buffering.

Each ``ToolStream`` instance owns its own ``pLCMTransport``, created lazily
on the first ``send`` and torn down by ``stop``.  No module- or process-level
state — the stream's lifetime is exactly the owning skill's lifetime.

class ToolStream:
    """A streaming channel for pushing updates from a skill to the agent.

    Each ``ToolStream`` is tied to a single logical tool invocation.
    **Must** be constructed inside a ``@skill`` call on the skill's own
    thread — that's where the per-call context (including the caller's
    ``progressToken``) is live and can be captured.  Constructing a
    ``ToolStream`` outside a ``@skill`` call raises ``RuntimeError``
    immediately; there is no silent fallback for that case.

    Once constructed, the instance is free-threaded: background threads
    spawned by the skill can call ``send`` and ``stop`` safely because
    the progress token is already captured on the instance.

    If the client that made the ``tools/call`` request did not supply a
    ``progressToken``, the stream still constructs successfully (the
    per-call context is an empty dict, not ``None``) and ``send`` falls
    back to emitting ``notifications/message`` log frames.  Real MCP
    clients (Claude Code, our ``McpClient``) always supply a token, so
    the fallback only covers raw curl callers.

    Most callers should prefer ``Module.start_tool`` / ``tool_update`` /
    ``stop_tool`` instead of constructing ``ToolStream`` directly.
