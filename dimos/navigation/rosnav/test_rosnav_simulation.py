"""
Integration test for the ROSNav Docker module.

Starts the navigation stack in simulation mode with Unity and verifies that
the ROS→DimOS bridge produces data on expected streams.  Requires an X11
display (real or virtual) for Unity to render.

Requires:
    - Docker with BuildKit
    - SSH key in agent for private repo clone (first build only)
    - ~17 GB disk for the Docker image

Run:
    pytest dimos/navigation/rosnav/test_rosnav_simulation.py -m slow -s
